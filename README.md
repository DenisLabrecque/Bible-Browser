# Bible-Browser
This Windows universal app is an attempt to make a speedy browser that can load [Zefania XML files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zefania-sharp/files/) into a reader. This is an app in progress, but planned to be uploaded to the Windows Store as soon as a working draft is ready (probably after July 2019).

Target features are:

**Tabbed Interface**
Like a browser, this Bible app is able to load many pages at once, allowing quick skipping between passages and versions.

**Search or Go to Reference**
Like a browser, this app will automatically search for text if not given a reference to go to.

**Reading Out Loud**
Capability for the computer to read the present chapter.

**Bilingual**
Cette application sera aussi disponible en fran√ßais.
