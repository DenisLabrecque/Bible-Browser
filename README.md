# Bible-Browser
This Windows universal app is an attempt to make a speedy browser that can load [Zefania XML files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zefania-sharp/files/) into a reader. This is an app in progress, but planned to be uploaded to the Windows Store as soon as a working draft is ready (probably in July or August 2019).
